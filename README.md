## Attributes

Tag attributes look similar to HTML (with optional commas), but their values are just regular JavaScript. 

```pug

- var autheticated = true
body(class=autheticated ? 'auth' 'anon')

```

## Multiline Attributes

If you have many attributes, you can also spread them across many lines: 

```pug

input(
    type="checkbox"
    name="checks"
    data-json=`{
        "very-long":"piece of data"
    }`
)

```

## Quoted Attributes

If your attribute name contains odd characters that might interfere with JavaScript syntax, <br/>
either quote it using "" or '', or use commas to separate different attributes. Examples of such <br/>
characters include [] and () (frequently used in Angular 2).

```pug

div(class='div-class', (click)='play()')
div(class='div-class' '(click)'='play()')

```

## Attribute Interpolation

Ways to include variables in attributes

* Write the atribute in JavaScript :

```pug

- var url ='index.html';
a(href="/"+url) Link

```

* If your JavaScript runtime supports ES2015 template strings  you can also use its syntax to simplify your attributes:

```pug

- var url = 'index.html';
a(href=`/root/${url}`) Link
```

## Unescaped Attributes

By default, all attributes are escaped—that is,special characters are replaced with escape sequences—to prevent attacks. 

```pug

div(escpaed="<code>")
div(unescpaed!="<code>")

```


## Boolean Attributes

Boolean attributes are mirrored by Pug. Boolean values (true and false) are accepted. <br/>
When no value is specified true is assumed.


## Style Attributes

The **style** attribute can be a string, like any normal attribute; but it can also be an object, <br/>
which is handy when styles are generated by JavaScript.

```pug

div(style={color:'red',background:'green'})

```

## Class Attributes

The **class** attribute can be a string, like any normal attribute; but it can also be <br/>
an array of class names, which is handy when generated from JavaScript.


```pug

- var classes = ['foo','btn','btn-log']
button(class=classes class=['bingo']) Bingo
        
```
It can also be an object which maps class names to **true** or **false** values. <br/>
This is useful for applying conditional classes

```pug
- var currentUrl = '/about'
a(class={active:currentUrl ==='/'} href="/") Home
a(class={active:currentUrl ==='/about'} href="/about") About

```

## Class Literal

Classes may be defined using a **.classname** syntax. Since div's are such a common choice of tag, <br/>
it is the default if you omit the tag name:

```pug
a.button
.content

```

## ID Literal

ID's may be defined by using a **#idname** syntax:

```pug

a#main-ling
#content
```

## &attributes

the **&attributes** syntax can be used to explode an object into attributes of an element.

```pug

- var attributes = {};
- attributes.class = 'baz';
div#foo(data-bar="foo")&attributes(attributes)

```

## Case

The **case** statement is a shorthand for JS **switch** statement:

```pug
- var friends = 10
case friends
    when 0
        p you have no friends
    when 1
        p you have a friend
    default
        p you have #{friends} friends

```

## Case Fall Through

You can use fall through, just as you would in a JavaScript **switch** statement.

```pug
- var friends = 0
case friends
  when 0
  when 1
    p you have very few friends
  default
    p you have #{friends} friends
    
// RESULT IS <p>you have very few friends</p>

```

If you would like to not output anything in a specific case, add an explicit unbuffered break:

```pug

- var friends = 0
case friends
    when 0
        - break
    when 1
        p you have very few friends
    default
        p you have #{friends} friends

```

## Block Expansion

Block expansion may also be used:

```pug

- var friends = 1
case friends
  when 0: p you have no friends
  when 1: p you have a friend
  default: p you have #{friends} friends

```

## Code 

Pug allows you to write inline JavaScript code in your templates. There are three <br/>
types of code: Unbuffered, Buffered, and Unescaped Buffered.


## Unbuffered Code

Unbuffered code starts with -. It does not directly add anything to the output.

```pug
- for (var x = 0; x < 3; x++)
    li item

```

## Buffered Code

Buffered code starts with =. It evaluates the JavaScript expression and outputs the result. For security, buffered code is first HTML escaped.

```pug

p
    ='This code is <escaped>!'

```

## Unescaped Buffered Code

Unescaped buffered code starts with **!=** . It evaluates the JavaScript expression and outputs the result.


```pug

p!= 'This code is' + ' <strong>not</strong> escaped!'

```

## Conditionals

Pug’s first-class conditional syntax allows for optional parentheses. Pug also provides the conditional **unless** , which works like a negated **if** .


```pug

- var user = {description:'foo bar baz'}
- var authorised = false
        
        #user
        if user.description
            h2.green Description
            p.description= user.description
        else if authorised
            p.description User has no description

```

## Includes

Includes allow you to insert the contents of one Pug file into another.

```pug
//- index.pug
doctype html
html
  include includes/head.pug
  body
    h1 My Site
    p Welcome to my super lame site.
    include includes/foot.pug

```
If no file extension is given, .pug is automatically appended to the file name.

## Including Plain Text

Including non-Pug files simply includes their raw text.

```pug
//- index.pug
doctype html
html
  head
    style
      include style.css
  body
    h1 My Site
    p Welcome to my super lame site.
    script
      include script.js

```

## String Interpolation, Escaped

**title** follows the basic pattern for evaluating a template local, but the code in between **#{** and **}** is evaluated, escaped, and the result buffered into the output of the template being rendered.

```pug
- var msg = "not my inside voice";
p This is #{msg.toUpperCase()}

```

## String Interpolation, Unescaped

```pug

- var quote = '<em>lorem ipsum</em>';
p Joel: !{quote}

```

## Tag Interpolation

Interpolation works not only on JavaScript values, but on Pug as well. Just use the tag interpolation syntax, like so:

```pug 
p.
  This is a very long and boring paragraph that spans multiple lines.
  Suddenly there is a #[strong strongly worded phrase] that cannot be
  #[em ignored].
p.
  And here's an example of an interpolated tag with an attribute:
  #[q(lang="es") ¡Hola Mundo!]

```

## Whitespace Control

The tag interpolation syntax is especially useful for inline tags, where <br/>
whitespace before and after the tag is significant.

By default, however, Pug removes all spaces before and after tags. <br/>
Check out the following example:

```pug
p
  | If I don't write the paragraph with tag interpolation, tags like
  strong strong
  | and
  em em
  | might produce unexpected results.
p.
  If I do, whitespace is #[strong respected] and #[em everybody] is happy.

```


## Iteration

Pug supports two primary methods of iteration: **each** and **while** .

## each

```pug
ul
  each val in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    li= val

```
You can also get the index as you iterate:

```pug
ul
  each val, index in ['zero', 'one', 'two']
    li= index + ': ' + val

```
Pug also lets you iterate over the keys in an object:

```pug
ul
  each val, key in {1: 'one', 2: 'two', 3: 'three'}
    li= key + ': ' + val

```

The object or array to iterate over is just plain JavaScript. So, it can <br/>
be a variable, or the result of a function call, or almost anything else.

```pug

- var values = [];
ul
  each val in values.length ? values : ['There are no values']
    li= val

```
or

```pug
- var values = [];
ul
  each val in values
    li= val
  else
    li There are no values

```

## while

You can use **while** to create a loop:


```pug
- var i =0;
ul
    while n < 4
        li !{n++}

```

## Mixins

Mixins allow you to create reusable block of Pug:

```pug

//- Declaration
mixin list
  ul
    li foo
    li bar
    li baz
//- Use
+list
+list

```

Mixins are compiled to functions, and can take arguments:

```pug
mixin pet(name)
  li.pet= name
ul
  +pet('cat')
  +pet('dog')
  +pet('pig')

```

## Mixin Attributes

Mixins also get an implicit **attributes** argument, which is taken from the attributes passed to the mixin:

```pug

mixin link(href,text)
    a(class!=attributes.class href=href)= text
            
+link('https://www.google.com','Google')(class="link-to")

```
The values in attributes by default are already escaped! You should use != to avoid escaping them a second time. <br/>

Other way to use attributes :

```pug
mixin link(href, name)
  a(href=href)&attributes(attributes)= name

+link('/foo', 'foo')(class="btn")

```
The syntax **+link(class="btn")** is also valid and equivalent to **+link()(class="btn")** , <br/>
since Pug tries to detect if parentheses’ contents are attributes or arguments. <br/>
Nevertheless, we encourage you to use the second syntax, as you pass explicitly <br/>
no arguments and you ensure the first parenthesis is the arguments list.

## Default Argument's Values

```pug
//- Declaration
mixin article(title='Default Title')
  .article
    .article-wrapper
      h1= title

//- Use
+article()

+article('Hello world')

```

## Rest Arguments

You can write mixins to take an unknow number of arguments:

```pug

mixin list(id,...rest)
    ul(id=id)
        each val in rest
            li=val

+list("my-list",1,2,3,4,5,"value of six")

```

## Plain Text

Pug provides four ways of getting plain text — that is, any code or text content that <br/>
should go, mostly unprocessed, directly into the rendered HTML. They are useful in different situations.


## Inline in a Tag 

he easiest way to add plain text is inline. The first term on the line is the tag itself.

```pug
p This is plain old <em>text</em> content.
```

## Literal HTML

Whole lines are also treated as plain text when they begin with a left angle bracket (**<**), <br/>
which may occasionally be useful for writing literal HTML tags in places that could otherwise be inconvenient. 


```pug

<html>

body
  p Indenting the body tag here would make no difference.
  p HTML itself isn't whitespace-sensitive.

</html>

```

## Piped text

Another way to add plain text to templates is to prefix a line with a pipe character (**|**).

```pug

p
  | The pipe always goes at the beginning of its own line,
  | not counting indentation.

```
## Block in a Tag

Often you might want large blocks of text within a tag. A good example is writing JavaScript and CSS code in the script and style tags. To do this, just add a **.** after the tag name.

## Block Expansion

```pug
a: img
```
## Self-Closing Tags

Tags such as img, meta, and link are automatically self-closing.You can also explicitly self close a tag by appending the **/** character. 

```pug

foo/
foo(class='baz')/

```
## Rendered Whitespace

Whitespace is removed from the beginning and end of tags, so that you have control over whether the rendered HTML elements touch or not.
